Key: Formula || Value: : q = CΔT, where C = heat capacity of the object.
Key: Relationship || Value: : C = m × c (heat capacity = mass × specific heat).
Key: Specific Heat (c) || Value: : The amount of energy needed to raise 1 gram of a substance by 1°C.
Key: Formula || Value: : q = mcΔT, where q = heat, m = mass, c = specific heat, ΔT = change in temperature.
Key: Water's Specific Heat || Value: : 4.184 J/g°C — very high, which is why water heats and cools slowly.
Key: Units || Value: : J/(g·°C) or cal/(g·°C).
Key: Enthalpy (H) || Value: : The total heat content of a system. ΔH < 0 = exothermic; ΔH > 0 = endothermic.
Key: Entropy (S) || Value: : A measure of disorder/randomness. ΔS > 0 means disorder increases.
Key: Gibbs Free Energy (G) || Value: : ΔG = ΔH − TΔS. If ΔG < 0, the reaction is spontaneous.
Key: Spontaneous Reaction || Value: : Occurs without continuous outside energy input (ΔG < 0).
Key: Calorimetry || Value: : The measurement of heat changes during chemical or physical processes.
Key: Calorimeter || Value: : A device used to measure heat exchange. A simple version is a coffee-cup calorimeter.
Key: Principle || Value: : q_lost = −q_gained. Heat lost by a hot object equals heat gained by a cold object.
Key: Bomb Calorimeter || Value: : Used for combustion reactions; measures heat at constant volume.
