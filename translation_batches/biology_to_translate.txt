## SUMMARY CONTENT (142)
A control group is essential for valid comparisons
Adaptation: Evolving over generations to survive
Agriculture: Agronomist, food scientist
All experiments must be reproducible by other scientists
All living organisms share certain characteristics that distinguish them from non-living things.
Anatomy: Study of body structures
Atom → Molecule → Organelle → Cell
Biochemistry: Study of chemical processes in living things
Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. The word comes from Greek: bios (life) + logos (study).
Biology uses the scientific method to investigate living systems. Scientists make observations, form hypotheses, conduct experiments, and draw conclusions.
Biosphere: All ecosystems on Earth
Biotechnology: Genetic engineer, biomedical engineer
Botany: Study of plants
Carbon Cycle: Photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, combustion
Cell Biology: Study of cell structure and function
Climate Change: Global warming affecting ecosystems worldwide
Climax Community: Stable, mature community
Commensalism: One benefits, other unaffected (e.g., barnacles on whales)
Community: All populations in an area
Competition: Organisms compete for limited resources
Conclusion: Analysis of results to accept or reject the hypothesis
Consumers (heterotrophs): Obtain energy by eating other organisms
Decomposers: Break down dead organisms and recycle nutrients
Ecology: Study of organisms and their environments
Ecosystem: Community plus the physical environment
Education: Teacher, professor, science communicator
Empirical: Based on observation and experimentation
Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction: from the sun → producers → consumers → decomposers.
Environment: Wildlife biologist, conservation scientist, ecologist
Experiment: A controlled test of the hypothesis
Food Chain: A single pathway of energy flow
Food Web: Interconnected food chains in an ecosystem
Forensics: Forensic scientist, crime scene investigator
Genetics: Study of heredity and genes
Growth: Increase in size and/or number of cells
Habitat Destruction: Clearing forests, draining wetlands, urbanization
Habitat: The physical place where an organism lives (its "address")
Healthcare: Doctor, nurse, pharmacist, physical therapist
Homeostasis: Maintaining stable internal conditions
Hypothesis: A testable explanation for observations
Intermediate Species: Grasses, shrubs, small trees
Invasive Species: Introducing non-native species that outcompete natives
Level 1: Producers (plants, algae)
Level 2: Primary consumers (herbivores)
Level 3: Secondary consumers (carnivores that eat herbivores)
Level 4: Tertiary consumers (top predators)
Life is organized in a hierarchy from simple to complex levels:
Living things share common characteristics that distinguish them from non-living matter.
Matter is never created or destroyed, only transformed and recycled through living and non-living components of the ecosystem.
Metabolism: Chemical reactions to obtain and use energy
Microbiology: Study of microorganisms
Mutualism: Both species benefit (e.g., bees and flowers)
Niche: The organism's role in its ecosystem (its "job")
Nitrogen Cycle: Nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification
Objective: Minimizes personal bias
Observation: Noticing and describing phenomena in nature
Only one variable should be changed at a time
Organization: Made of one or more cells
Overexploitation: Overfishing, overhunting, overharvesting
Parasitism: One benefits, other is harmed (e.g., ticks on dogs)
Phosphorus Cycle: Weathering of rocks, uptake by organisms, decomposition
Physiology: Study of body functions
Pioneer Species: First organisms to colonize (lichens, mosses)
Pollution: Air, water, and soil contamination
Population → Community → Ecosystem → Biosphere
Population: All members of a species in one area
Predation: One organism (predator) kills and eats another (prey)
Primary Succession: Occurs in lifeless areas with no soil (e.g., bare rock, lava)
Producers (autotrophs): Make their own food through photosynthesis
Reproduction: Producing offspring
Research: Laboratory scientist, clinical researcher
Response: Reacting to stimuli in the environment
Scientific Law: A description of a natural phenomenon that always occurs (e.g., law of gravity)
Scientific Theory: A well-tested explanation supported by extensive evidence (e.g., cell theory, evolution)
Secondary Succession: Occurs in areas where a community was disturbed but soil remains (e.g., after a fire)
Symbiosis: Close, long-term relationships between species
Tentative: Conclusions can change with new evidence
Testable: Claims can be verified or falsified
The rest is lost as heat through metabolic processes
