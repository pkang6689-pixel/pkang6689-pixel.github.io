## SUMMARY CONTENT (9)
A biconditional statement (p ↔ q) means "p if and only if q." It is true when both p and q have the same truth value.
A conditional statement has the form "If p, then q" (written p → q). The hypothesis is p and the conclusion is q.
A ratio compares two quantities. It can be written as a:b, a/b, or "a to b".
A sector is a "pie slice" of a circle defined by a central angle θ.
Conjecture: "All prime numbers are odd." Counterexample: 2 is prime and even.
Conjunction (p ∧ q): "p AND q" — true only when BOTH p and q are true.
Disjunction (p ∨ q): "p OR q" — true when AT LEAST ONE of p or q is true.
In spherical geometry, "lines" are great circles. There are no parallel lines — every pair of great circles intersects at two points.
When the conclusion involves uniqueness ("there is exactly one...").
