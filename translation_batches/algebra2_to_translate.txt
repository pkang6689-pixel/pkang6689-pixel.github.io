## SUMMARY CONTENT (232)
AP Connections: Higher-degree polynomials appear in optimization in calculus. Taylor series approximate functions using polynomials. Interpolation fits n points with degree n-1 polynomial.
AP Connections: Linear programming and system optimization appear in AP Calculus as constrained optimization and Lagrange multipliers. Understanding these foundations is essential for advanced mathematics.
AP Connections: Mathematical induction foundation for many calculus proofs and theorem verification. Recursive functions and sequences central to analysis. The principle of induction connects to the completeness axiom in real number system, essential for rigorous calculus development.
AP Connections: Natural exponential and logarithm are the fundamental functions in calculus. d/dx(e^x) = e^x and d/dx(ln x) = 1/x. Integration of 1/x gives ln|x|. Taylor series for e^x, sin(x), cos(x) appear throughout calculus.
AP Connections: Rational functions appear in optimization problems (minimize cost, maximize profit). L'Hôpital's Rule in calculus uses these to evaluate limits. Partial fraction decomposition is used for integration.
AP Connections: Regression inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests) are central to AP Statistics. Understanding sampling distributions of estimators connects to calculus-based probability and limits. LOWESS regression and smoothing lead to advanced statistical methods.
AP Connections: Trigonometric functions are periodic. Derivatives: d/dx(sin x) = cos x, d/dx(cos x) = -sin x. Integration of sin/cos appears throughout calculus. Exponential and trig connection via Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cos θ + i sin θ.
Adding Polynomials: Combine like terms (same variable and exponent). Arrange terms in descending order. Group coefficients of each power separately.
Adding and Subtracting: Find a common denominator (usually the LCD). Rewrite each fraction. Add/subtract numerators; denominator stays the same. Simplify the result. Include domain restrictions from both original expressions.
Advantages: Elimination is more efficient when coefficients are large or when substitution creates messy fractions. It avoids the need to isolate variables first.
Algebraic Methods: Prepare to learn substitution and elimination methods in the next lessons. Both methods transform the system to isolate variables and find the solution.
Algebraic Techniques: Factor: sin x cos x - sin x = 0 → sin x (cos x - 1) = 0. Quadratic formula: 2 sin² x - sin x - 1 = 0 using substitution u = sin x. Use identities to simplify before solving.
Analyzing Behavior: Near vertical asymptote, function approaches +∞ or -∞ depending on sign of denominator from left/right. Test points on either side to determine which direction.
Angle Between Vectors: cos θ = (u·v)/(|u||v|). Orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors: u·v = 0. Parallel vectors: one is scalar multiple of other. Component of u along v: (u·v)/|v|.
Application Extensions: Complex mixture problems with three or more substances. Optimization problems with multiple constraints and real-world parameters.
Applications: Exponential growth/decay (bacteria, investments). Fractals and self-similar structures. Bouncing ball problems (heights form geometric sequence). Depreciation: asset value decreases by constant percentage.
Applications: Finding the vertex of a parabola. Verifying solutions to quadratic equations. Converting to forms for specific uses like optimization problems.
Applications: Linear patterns in data. Counting: total items in stepped arrangement. Time intervals: events at regular intervals. Savings plans: deposit fixed amount each period.
Applications: Medical diagnosis: likelihood of disease given test result. Quality control: probability defective given supplier. Database queries: probability matching criteria given constraints.
Applications: Passwords: each position could be different letter/digit. Seating arrangements. Top finishers in race. Anagrams of words (with and without repeated letters).
Applications: Projectile motion: x(t) = v₀cos θ·t, y(t) = v₀sin θ·t - ½gt². Cycloid: x = r(t - sin t), y = r(1 - cos t). Parametric curves used extensively in physics and calculus for motion analysis.
Applications: Radioactive decay: N(t) = N_0 e^{-μt}. Half-life calculation when N(t) = N_0/2. pH in chemistry: pH = -log[H⁺]. Earthquake magnitude: M = log(I/I_0).
Applications: Repeating decimals to fractions. Fractal areas and lengths (Koch snowflake). Loan and mortgage calculations using present value. Annuities and perpetuities in finance.
Arithmetic Sequence: Sequence with constant difference d between consecutive terms. a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Example: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14... has a_1 = 2, d = 3. The common difference can be negative or zero.
Arithmetic with Complex Numbers: Add/subtract real parts and imaginary parts separately. Multiply using FOIL, remembering i² = -1. Divide by multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator.
Assumptions for Linear Regression: Linearity (relationship is linear), independence (observations independent), normality (residuals approximately normal), equal variance (residuals have constant spread for all x).
Average Cost: If fixed cost is F and variable cost per unit is v, total cost C(n) = F + vn for n units. Average cost A(n) = C(n)/n = (F + vn)/n. This is a rational function with a horizontal asymptote at y = v.
Basic Trig Equations: sin x = a, cos x = a, tan x = a for |a| ≤ 1 (sine/cosine). Find reference angle, then use quadrant information to find all solutions. General solutions include ± 2πn or ± πn depending on function.
Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) · P(A) / P(B). Relates conditional probabilities in both directions. Used in medical testing: P(disease|positive test) involves test accuracy.
Binomial Coefficient: C(n,r) is the coefficient in binomial expansion (a+b)^n. Pascal's triangle shows these coefficients. C(n,0) = 1, C(n,n) = 1, C(n,r) = C(n,n-r).
Break-Even Problems: Find where revenue equals cost. Set profit function equal to zero or set revenue equal to expense. The intersection point is the break-even point.
Change of Base Formula: log_b(x) = log(x)/log(b) = ln(x)/ln(b). Allows computing any logarithm using calculator (which typically has log base 10 and natural log).
Checking Reasonableness: Does the solution make sense in context? For quantities, expect positive values. For rates, check if they're realistic. Always verify by substituting into the original problem.
Checking Solutions: Exponential equations: check by substituting. Logarithmic equations: verify that arguments are positive (domain restriction of logarithm). Extraneous solutions can appear when applying properties.
Checking Solutions: Substitute the x and y values into both original equations. The solution is correct if both equations are satisfied.
Circle: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r². Center (h, k), radius r. Equation of tangent line perpendicular to radius at point of tangency. Distance formula finds radius given center and point.
Combinations vs Permutations: Choosing 3 from {A,B,C,D,E}: combinations give ABC, ABD, ABE, ACD, ACE, ADE, BCD, BCE, BDE, CDE (10 total). Same objects in different order → same combination but different permutations.
Combinations: Selection of objects where ORDER DOESN'T MATTER. C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!), also written "n choose r". Always C(n,r) ≤ P(n,r). Example: choosing 3 of 5 books: C(5,3) = 5!/(3!2!) = 10.
Combining Transformations: y = a(x-h)² + k applies all transformations. The order matters: horizontal/vertical shifts, then stretches/compressions. Reading transformations from vertex form is straightforward.
Common Application Types: Mixture problems: combining items at different rates. Distance problems: using distance = rate × time. Investment problems: combining different interest rates.
Comparing Functions: Linear functions grow fastest for small x, but exponential eventually dominates. Logarithmic functions grow slowest. For very large x: exponential > linear > logarithmic.
Complex Conjugates: For a + bi, the conjugate is a - bi. When a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex zero, its conjugate is also a zero. Complex zeros come in conjugate pairs.
Complex Fractions: Fractions with fractions in numerator/denominator. Simplify by finding LCM of all denominators and multiplying numerator and denominator by it. Or treat numerator and denominator separately, simplify, then divide.
Complex Numbers: Form a + bi where a and b are real and i² = -1. Real part is a, imaginary part is b. Complex numbers extend our number system to allow nth roots of any polynomial.
Components: Objective function: what we're maximizing/minimizing (P = ax + by). Constraints: limitations on variables (system of inequalities). Feasible region: all points satisfying all constraints.
Concentration and Mixture: If x grams of substance are diluted in y milliliters of liquid, concentration = x/y g/mL. Adding more liquid increases denominator, decreasing concentration. These become rational function models.
Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Probability of A given B has occurred. Denominator is not 100% but P(B). Example: P(roll 3 | die is even) = P(3 and even) / P(even) = 0 / (1/2) = 0.
Confidence Intervals: Range estimate for population parameter. 95% confidence interval means 95% of such intervals would contain true parameter. General formula: estimate ± (critical value) × (standard error). For mean: x̄ ± t* × s/√n.
Conic Sections Definition: Curves formed by intersecting plane with a cone. Circle: plane perpendicular to axis. Ellipse: plane at angle. Parabola: plane parallel to side. Hyperbola: plane cuts both nappes.
Continuous Compound Interest: A = Pe^{rt} is the continuous version of interest compounding. As compounding frequency increases, (1+r/n)^{nt} → e^{rt}. This is the most efficient interest calculation.
Convergence Condition: Geometric series converges if and only if |r| < 1 (r is strictly between -1 and 1). The sum S = a/(1-r) is a finite value. When |r| ≥ 1, partial sums increase without bound.
Cooling Law: T(t) = T_s + (T_0 - T_s)e^{-kt} describes temperature decrease. T_s is surrounding temperature, T_0 is initial temperature, k is cooling rate. Temperature approaches T_s asymptotically.
Cosine Function: y = cos(x) has amplitude 1, period 2π. Key points: (0, 1), (π/2, 0), (π, -1), (3π/2, 0), (2π, 1). Shifts sine left by π/2: cos(x) = sin(x + π/2).
Coterminal Angles: Angles that differ by multiple of 360° (or 2π radians). Example: 30°, 390°, -330° are coterminal. Coterminal angle formula: θ + 360n° or θ + 2πn.
Cross-Multiplication: For equations like A/B = C/D, cross-multiply: AD = BC. This shortcut is valid and often simpler than finding LCD, but still check for extraneous solutions.
De Moivre's Theorem: [r cis θ]ⁿ = rⁿ cis(nθ). Power simplification. Example: (1 + i)¹⁰. Finding nth roots: z^(1/n) = r^(1/n) cis((θ + 2πk)/n) for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.
Decibel Scale: dB = 10 log(I/I_0) for intensity. Logarithmic scale compresses wide ranges. Small dB changes represent large intensity changes.
Decision Rule: If p-value < α, reject H₀ (statistically significant). If p-value ≥ α, fail to reject H₀ (insufficient evidence). Common α: 0.05 or 0.01.
Degree Measure: Full rotation = 360°. Right angle = 90°. Straight angle = 180°. Acute angle < 90°, obtuse angle 90° < angle < 180°. Angle measured counterclockwise from standard position (positive ray of x-axis).
Dependent Events: Events A and B are dependent if P(A then B) = P(A) · P(B|A) where P(B|A) is conditional probability of B given A occurred. Drawing without replacement creates dependency.
Derivatives Parametrically: dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt). Not dy/dx obtained by implicit differentiation. Acceleration vector: a(t) = (d²x/dt², d²y/dt²). Velocity vector: v(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt), speed |v(t)| = √((dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)²).
Descartes' Rule of Signs: Count sign changes in p(x) to estimate positive roots. Count sign changes in p(-x) to estimate negative roots. Number of real roots of each type is at most this count and differs by an even number.
Difference of Squares: a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b). Recognizable as two perfect squares with a minus sign between them. Can apply multiple times for higher powers.
Dividing: Multiply by the reciprocal: (P/Q) ÷ (R/S) = (P/Q) × (S/R). Simplify as with multiplication. Important: the reciprocal's denominator is S, which must be non-zero.
Domain and Range: Domain is all real numbers. Range depends on the vertex and direction. If opens up: range is [k, ∞). If opens down: range is (-∞, k].
Domain and Range: The domain is the set of all possible input values, while the range is the set of all possible output values. Restrictions occur when denominators are zero or when values are under even-root radicals.
Double Angle Formulas: sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x. cos 2x = cos² x - sin² x = 2 cos² x - 1 = 1 - 2 sin² x. tan 2x = 2 tan x / (1 - tan² x).
Eliminating Parameter: Solve one equation for t, substitute into other. Example: x = 2t + 1, y = t² → t = (x-1)/2 → y = ((x-1)/2)². Check for domain/range restrictions preserved in conversion.
Ellipse: (x-h)²/a² + (y-k)²/b² = 1 (horizontal) or swap a, b (vertical). Center (h, k). Major axis length 2a, minor axis 2b. Foci at distance c where c² = a² - b². Eccentricity e = c/a < 1.
End Behavior: Determined by the degree and leading coefficient. For very large/small x, the polynomial behaves like its leading term ax^n. Odd degree with positive a: goes from bottom-left to top-right. Negative a: top-left to bottom-right.
Equivalent Expressions: P(x)/Q(x) and [P(x) × R(x)]/[Q(x) × R(x)] are equivalent rational expressions (same domain restrictions). Use this to find common denominators or create equivalent forms.
Euler's Formula & Applications: e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ. Complex exponential connects trig functions. Applications in physics: wave equations, oscillations, quantum mechanics. Solving z^n = 1 gives nth roots of unity equally spaced on unit circle.
Exact Values: Common angles have known exact values. sin(0) = 0, sin(π/6) = 1/2, sin(π/4) = √2/2, sin(π/3) = √3/2, sin(π/2) = 1. Cosine values reverse for complement.
Exponential Decay: When 0 < b < 1, f(x) = ab^x decays. The smaller b, the faster decay. Graph approaches 0 from above as x → ∞. Common form: f(x) = a(1/2)^{x/h} where h is half-life.
Exponential Functions: Form f(x) = ab^x where a ≠ 0, b > 0, b ≠ 1. Base b determines growth (b > 1) or decay (0 < b < 1). The graph is always positive and approaches 0 as x → -∞ (for growth).
Exponential Growth: When b > 1, f(x) = ab^x grows exponentially. The larger b, the faster the growth. Doubling time or tripling time describes how long for the function to double or triple in value.
Extraneous Solutions: When clearing denominators, we might introduce solutions that make the original denominator zero. These are extraneous. Always verify: substitute back and check if any denominator becomes zero.
Factorial: 0! = 1 (definition), 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, etc. Grows very fast. Used in permutation and combination calculations.
Factoring Trinomials: For ax² + bx + c, find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. Use these to split the middle term, then factor by grouping. Alternatively, use the AC method.
Finance: Compound interest A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}. Continuous compounding: A = Pe^{rt}. Present value given future value. Investment problems using logarithms to solve for time.
Finding Key Points: y-intercept by setting x=0. x-intercepts (zeros) by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Axis of symmetry is x = h. Use symmetry to find additional points on the parabola.
Finding Probabilities: P(X ≤ a) requires standardizing to Z, then using table. P(a c) = 1 - P(X ≤ c).
Finding Restrictions: Set denominator equal to zero: Q(x) = 0. Solve for x. These x-values are excluded from the domain. Write in domain restriction notation.
Finding Sum: First, identify first term a and common ratio r. Check |r| < 1 for convergence. If convergent, S = a/(1-r). Useful for repeating decimals: 0.333... = 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ... = (3/10)/(1 - 1/10) = 1/3.
Finding Terms: Given a_1 and r, find any term using a_n = a_1 · r^{n-1}. Common ratio: r = a_{n+1}/a_n. Handle negative ratios (alternating sign sequences). To insert geometric means between two terms, compute appropriate r and generate intermediates.
Finding Terms: Once a_1 and d known, any term can be found: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. To find d: d = (a_m - a_k)/(m - k). To insert arithmetic means between two terms, find common difference and generate intermediate terms.
Finding Zeros: Combined with the Rational Root Theorem, these help identify possible zeros quickly. Test candidates using synthetic division (factor theorem). List factors and corresponding zeros systematically.
Finding the Vertex: Use x = -b/(2a) to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. Substitute into f(x) to find the y-coordinate. Vertex (h,k) is the extreme point of the parabola.
Function Notation: f(x) represents the output of function f when the input is x. This replaces the older y = notation and makes it clear which variable is the input.
Functions are relations that assign exactly one output to each input. A function f(x) can be evaluated by substituting a value for x and simplifying.
Fundamental Counting Principle: If first event has m outcomes and second event has n outcomes, total outcomes is m × n. Extends to multiple events: multiply all possibilities. Example: 3 appetizers, 4 mains, 2 desserts → 3 × 4 × 2 = 24 meals.
Fundamental Identities: sin² x + cos² x = 1 (Pythagorean). tan x = sin x / cos x. cot x = cos x / sin x. sec x = 1 / cos x. csc x = 1 / sin x.
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: A degree n polynomial with complex coefficients has exactly n zeros (counting multiplicity), all lying in ℂ (complex numbers). Real polynomials may have real or complex zeros.
Geometric Sequence: Sequence with constant ratio r between consecutive terms. a_n = a_1 · r^{n-1}. Example: 2, 6, 18, 54... has a_1 = 2, r = 3. Each term is r times the previous term.
Graph Characteristics: Passes through (1, 0) because log_b(1) = 0. Passes through (b, 1) because log_b(b) = 1. Increasing if b > 1, decreasing if 0 < b < 1. Slow growth: logarithmic growth is much slower than exponential.
Graphical Solutions: Graph each line and find intersection point(s). One intersection = unique solution. Parallel lines = no solution. Same line = infinitely many solutions.
Graphing Linear Equations: Plot the y-intercept, then use slope to find another point. Slope indicates rise over run: positive slopes go ↗, negative slopes go ↘.
Graphing on Number Line: Mark the boundary point. Shade left of the point if x < or x ≤, right if x > or x ≥. Use open circle for strict inequalities, closed for ≤/≥.
Greatest Common Factor (GCF): Always check for a common factor in all terms first. Factor out the GCF; this is factoring by grouping applied to all terms.
Half-Life: Time required for quantity to reduce to half its value. After one half-life, 50% remains. After two half-lives, 25% remains (50% of 50%). n half-lives: (1/2)^n fraction remains.
Holes in the Graph: If numerator and denominator share a factor (x-c), both have a zero at c. This cancels to a hole (removable discontinuity), not an asymptote. Find the y-coordinate by evaluating the simplified function at x = c.
Horizontal Asymptotes: Determine by comparing degrees of numerator and denominator. If degree of numerator denominator degree: no horizontal asymptote.
Horizontal Shifts: f(x-h) shifts the parabola h units right (h>0) or left (h<0). Vertex moves from (h₁,k) to (h₁+h,k). The axis of symmetry shifts accordingly.
Hypothesis Testing: Test H₀ (null hypothesis) vs Hₐ (alternative). Type I error: reject H₀ when true (α significance level). Type II error: fail to reject H₀ when false (β). p-value: probability of observing data as extreme given H₀ is true.
Independent Events: Events A and B are independent if P(A and B) = P(A) · P(B). One event doesn't affect the other. Examples: coin flips, die rolls.
Induction Examples: Prove Σ_{i=1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2. Prove geometric sequence formula a_n = a_1 · r^{n-1}. Prove statements about divisibility: 3^n - 1 is always divisible by 2.
Infinite Geometric Series: a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... where |r| < 1 converges to a/(1-r). If |r| ≥ 1, the series diverges (sum is infinite or undefined). Tests for convergence depend on common ratio.
Interpreting Results: Discriminant tells us about roots without solving. Helps predict the graph: two x-intercepts, one x-intercept, or no x-intercepts.
Interpreting Solutions: Pick a test point in the shaded region to verify it satisfies both inequalities. The entire shaded region represents the solution set.
Inverse Problem: Given probability, find the value. Example: Find c such that P(X < c) = 0.90. Use Z-table in reverse to find z, then solve X = μ + z·σ.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions: y = arcsin x, arccos x, arctan x give principal values in restricted ranges. sin⁻¹(x) ∈ [-π/2, π/2], cos⁻¹(x) ∈ [0, π], tan⁻¹(x) ∈ (-π/2, π/2).
Key Features: Vertex: minimum (a>0) or maximum (aAxis of symmetry: divides parabola in half. y-intercept: at (0,c). x-intercepts: where parabola crosses x-axis (roots).
Key Properties: log_b(bx) = 1, log_b(1) = 0, log_b(b) = 1. Inverse relationship: b^{log_b(x)} = x and log_b(b^x) = x. Domain: x > 0 only.
Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C. Use for SAS or SSS. Relates all three sides to an angle. Special case: when C = 90°, reduces to Pythagorean theorem.
Law of Sines: a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C. Use when you have ASA, AAS, or SSA (ambiguous). In triangle with angles A, B, C and opposite sides a, b, c respectively. Solves non-right triangles.
Linear Inequalities: Similar to equations, but with <, >, ≤, or ≥. When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the inequality sign. Solution is a ray (half-line), shown with open circle for </> or closed for ≤/≥.
Logarithm Definition: y = log_b(x) means b^y = x. Logarithm is the inverse of exponential. Base b > 0, b ≠ 1. Common base: log_10(x) = log(x). Natural base: log_e(x) = ln(x).
Logarithmic Functions: f(x) = log_b(x). These are inverse functions of f(x) = b^x. Domain: x > 0. Range: all real numbers. Graph has vertical asymptote at x = 0.
Logarithmic Properties: log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y) (product rule). log_b(x/y) = log_b(x) - log_b(y) (quotient rule). log_b(x^n) = n·log_b(x) (power rule).
Making Coefficients Opposite: If the same variable has coefficients like 2 and 3, multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by -2 to create coefficients 6 and -6. When added, they cancel.
Mathematical Induction: Proof technique for statements about all positive integers. Two steps: (1) Base case: prove statement true for n = 1. (2) Inductive step: assume true for n = k, prove it's true for n = k+1. Proves infinitely many cases with finite work.
Multiplication & Division in Polar Form: Product: z₁z₂ = r₁r₂ cis(θ₁ + θ₂). Quotient: z₁/z₂ = (r₁/r₂) cis(θ₁ - θ₂). Real and imaginary parts multiply in polar but angles add/subtract.
Multiplicity: If (x-c) appears k times in the factorization, c has multiplicity k. At an intercept with odd multiplicity, the graph crosses the x-axis. With even multiplicity, it touches but doesn't cross.
Multiplying Polynomials: Use FOIL for binomials or the distributive property for general cases. FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last. For longer polynomials, multiply each term in the first by every term in the second.
Multiplying: Factor all numerators and denominators. Cancel common factors. Multiply remaining numerators and denominators. Result is automatically simplified. Watch for restrictions from cancelled factors.
Natural Logarithm: ln(x) = log_e(x). Its inverse is y = e^x. Properties identical to all logarithms with base e. ln(e) = 1, ln(1) = 0, e^{ln(x)} = x, ln(e^x) = x.
Normal Distribution: Bell curve, symmetric around mean μ. Characterized by mean and standard deviation σ. Z-score: (X - μ)/σ standardizes to N(0,1). Empirical rule: 68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ.
Oblique Asymptotes: For n(x)/d(x) where deg(n) = deg(d) + 1, divide to get quotient q(x) + remainder. The asymptote is y = q(x). As x → ±∞, the function approaches this line.
Operations with Functions: Functions can be combined through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Composition of functions (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) means apply g first, then apply f to the result.
Optimization: Perimeter problems that lead to area quadratics. Garden fence problems: find dimensions that maximize area with fixed perimeter. Area = length × width, then substitute using the constraint.
Parabola & Hyperbola: Parabola: (y-k)² = 4p(x-h) (horizontal) or (x-h)² = 4p(y-k) (vertical). Vertex (h, k), focus, directrix p units away. Hyperbola: (x-h)²/a² - (y-k)²/b² = 1 (horizontal) or reversed. Asymptotes: y - k = ±(b/a)(x - h). Eccentricity e = c/a > 1 where c² = a² + b².
Parametric Representation: Describe curve using x = f(t), y = g(t) where t is parameter. Often t represents time. Example: x = 3cos(t), y = 3sin(t), t ∈ [0, 2π] traces circle x² + y² = 9. Eliminates parameter to get Cartesian equation.
Perfect Square Trinomials: (x + p)² = x² + 2px + p². The constant term is the square of half the coefficient of x. To complete: take b/2, square it, then add and subtract.
Periodicity & Signs: Trigonometric functions repeat every 2π radians. Signs vary by quadrant: Q1 all positive, Q2 sin positive, Q3 tan positive, Q4 cos positive.
Permutations: Arrangement of objects where ORDER MATTERS. n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1. Permutations of n objects taken r at a time: P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!. Example: arranging 3 of 5 books: P(5,3) = 5!/2! = 60.
Point-Slope Form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁) is useful when you know a point on the line and the slope. This form can be rearranged to slope-intercept form.
Polar Form of Complex Numbers: z = a + bi = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = r cis θ where r = |z| = √(a² + b²) and θ = arg(z). Conversion: a = r cos θ, b = r sin θ. θ is angle from positive real axis, measured counterclockwise.
Polynomial Definition: A sum of terms with non-negative integer exponents. Degree is the highest exponent. Leading coefficient is the coefficient of the highest-degree term. Standard form arranges terms from highest to lowest degree.
Population Growth: P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} (continuous) or P(t) = P_0(1+r)^t (discrete). r is growth rate. Doubling time: 0.693/r (continuous). Applications: bacteria, human population, viral spread.
Power Reduction: sin² x = (1 - cos 2x)/2. cos² x = (1 + cos 2x)/2. Used to simplify expressions and solve equations.
Practical Applications: Loan amortization uses series formulas. Monthly payment computed using present value of annuity. Stock dividend accumulation. Pendulum oscillation amplitudes (geometric decay). Recursive sequences define many real systems.
Probability Definition: P(event) = (favorable outcomes)/(total outcomes) for equally likely outcomes. Ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). 0% to 100%. Complement rule: P(not A) = 1 - P(A).
Probability with Combinations: Many problems use C(n,r) to count favorable outcomes. Example: probability of 2 heads in 3 coin flips: C(3,2)/2^3 = 3/8. Lottery odds: C(49,6) total combinations.
Productivity and Diminishing Returns: Models like P(x) = kx/(1 + ax) where productivity increases then levels off. The horizontal asymptote k/a represents maximum productivity as x → ∞.
Profit and Revenue: Profit P(x) = Revenue - Cost = R(x) - C(x). Often quadratic. Find maximum profit at the vertex. Break-even points are where P(x) = 0 (setting revenue equal to cost).
Projectile Motion: Height h(t) = -16t² + v₀t + h₀, where v₀ is initial velocity and h₀ is initial height. The maximum height occurs at the vertex. Set h(t) = 0 to find when the object hits the ground.
Properties of Exponents: b^{x+y} = b^x · b^y, b^{xy} = (b^x)^y, b^{-x} = 1/b^x. These properties allow solving exponential equations algebraically when bases are equal.
Quadratic Functions: Functions of the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c where a ≠ 0. The graph is a parabola (U-shaped curve). The coefficient a determines the direction: a > 0 opens upward, a < 0 opens downward.
Radian Measure: Based on arc length. 1 radian = arc length equals radius. Full rotation = 2π radians = 360°. Conversion: radians = degrees × π/180°, degrees = radians × 180°/π.
Radioactive Decay: N(t) = N_0 e^{-μt} where λ is decay constant. Relates to half-life: half-life = ln(2)/λ. Used for carbon dating and nuclear material calculations.
Rational Expressions: Fractions with polynomials in numerator and denominator. Form P(x)/Q(x) where Q(x) ≠ 0. Domain excludes values making the denominator zero (restrictions).
Rational Root Theorem: For polynomial p(x) with integer coefficients, any rational root p/q (in lowest terms) has p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient. This narrows possible rational zeros significantly.
Reading the Result: Quotient has degree one less than the dividend. If remainder is 0, (x-c) is a factor. If remainder is non-zero, R(x) = R and result is Q(x) + R/(x-c).
Real-World Applications: Navigation and bearings: angle measured from north. Height problems: angle of elevation/depression. Projectile motion: initial velocity at angle θ. Harmonic motion: position = A cos(ωt + φ).
Real-World Models: Continuous growth: A(t) = Pe^{rt}. Compound interest: A(t) = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}. Both are exponential models with slightly different forms.
Reference Angles: Acute angle between terminal side and x-axis. Used to find trig values for any angle. Reference angle always between 0° and 90°.
Regression Line Equation: \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x. Slope b_1 = r × (s_y/s_x), y-intercept b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}. Confidence intervals for slope: slope ± t* × SE(b_1). Hypothesis tests on correlation using t-statistic.
Sample Space & Events: Sample space is all possible outcomes. Event is subset of sample space. Experiment can produce random outcomes. Example: die roll has sample space {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
Series: Sum of terms in a sequence. Arithmetic series: a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. Geometric series: a_1 + a_1r + a_1r^2 + ... + a_1r^{n-1}. Infinite series: sum of infinitely many terms (may or may not converge).
Setting Up Real-World Models: Identify the variable (usually time or quantity). Write the quadratic equation based on given information. Use the vertex to find maximum/minimum, or solve equations for specific outcomes.
Setting Up Synthetic Division: Write coefficients of the dividend in descending order; include 0 for missing terms. The constant c (from x - c) goes as the divisor on the left. Use a special box/table format.
Setting Up Word Problems: Identify the unknowns and assign variables. Translate each sentence into an equation. For mixture, distance, and investment problems, organize information in a table.
Simplifying Rational Expressions: Factor numerator and denominator completely. Cancel common factors. Be careful: you can only cancel factors, not terms. The cancelled term represents the restriction on the domain.
Sine Function: y = sin(x) has amplitude 1, period 2π. Oscillates between -1 and 1. Passes through origin (0, 0). Key points: (π/2, 1), (π, 0), (3π/2, -1), (2π, 0).
Sketching Polynomials: Find zeros and their multiplicities. Determine end behavior. Plot a few additional points. Connect smoothly, respecting behavior at zeros.
Sketching the Graph: Find vertical asymptotes and holes. Find horizontal asymptotes. Find x-intercepts and y-intercept. Plot several test points. Sketch smoothly, respecting asymptotes and approaching them asymptotically.
Sketching the Parabola: Plot the vertex and axis of symmetry first. Plot the y-intercept and its symmetric point. Find and plot x-intercepts if they exist. Use the shape (determined by a) to sketch a smooth U or inverted-U curve.
Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Slope represents the rate of change: m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁).
Solutions on Intervals: Specify interval like [0, 2π] to list finite. For x ∈ [0, 2π], sin x = 1/2 has solutions x = π/6, 5π/6. Check domain restrictions (tan x undefined at π/2, etc.).
Solving Exponential Equations: If bases are equal, exponents are equal: b^m = b^n → m = n. If bases aren't equal, take logarithm of both sides. Use logarithm properties to simplify.
Solving Linear Equations: Isolate the variable using inverse operations. Always perform the same operation on both sides to maintain equality. Check solutions by substituting back into the original equation.
Solving Logarithmic Equations: Use exponential (inverse) form: if log_b(x) = k, then x = b^k. Properties of logarithms can condense or expand terms before converting to exponential form.
Solving Quadratic Inequalities: Inequalities like ax² + bx + c > 0. First solve the corresponding equation ax² + bx + c = 0 to find boundary points. These boundary points divide the number line into intervals.
Solving Rational Equations: Equations with rational expressions. Find the LCD of all denominators. Multiply every term by the LCD to clear denominators. Solve the resulting polynomial equation. Always check solutions in the original equation.
Solving Steps: (1) Write objective function. (2) Write constraints as inequalities. (3) Graph feasible region. (4) Find corner points. (5) Evaluate objective function at each corner. (6) Identify the maximum/minimum.
Special Patterns: Perfect square trinomials: a² + 2ab + b² = (a+b)². Sum/difference of cubes: a³ + b³ = (a+b)(a²-ab+b²). Factoring by grouping for four-term polynomials.
Special Sums: Σ_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n, Σ_{i=1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2, Σ_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6, Σ_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = [n(n+1)/2]^2. These formulas allow closed forms for many series.
Standard Normal Distribution: Mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. Denoted Z ~ N(0,1). Z-table gives cumulative probability P(Z ≤ z). Any normal random variable can be converted to standard form: Z = (X - μ)/σ.
Standard and Vertex Forms: Standard form: f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Vertex form: f(x) = a(x-h)² + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Vertex form makes the parabola's features immediately visible.
Step-by-Step Process: (1) Factor out a from ax² + bx. (2) Take half of b: (b/2). (3) Square it: (b/2)². (4) Add and subtract inside the parentheses. (5) Factor the perfect square and simplify.
Step-by-Step Process: (1) Multiply equation(s) to make coefficients opposites. (2) Add the equations. (3) Solve for the remaining variable. (4) Substitute back to find the other variable.
Step-by-Step Process: (1) Solve one equation for one variable (choose the easiest). (2) Substitute the expression into the other equation. (3) Solve the resulting one-variable equation. (4) Back-substitute to find the other variable.
Subtracting Polynomials: Distribute the negative sign to all terms of the polynomial being subtracted, then combine like terms. Be careful with signs!
Sum and Difference Formulas: sin(A ± B) = sin A cos B ± cos A sin B. cos(A ± B) = cos A cos B ∓ sin A sin B. tan(A ± B) = (tan A ± tan B) / (1 ∓ tan A tan B).
Sum of Arithmetic Sequence: S_n = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n) = (n/2)(2a_1 + (n-1)d). Gauss's formula: sum of first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2. Sum is always the average of first and last term, times the count.
Sum of Geometric Sequence: If r ≠ 1: S_n = a_1(1 - r^n)/(1 - r) = a_1(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). If r = 1: S_n = na_1. The formula works even with negative r.
Summation Notation: Σ symbol denotes sum. Σ_{i=1}^{n} a_i means a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n. Index i is the summation variable. Lower limit (below Σ) and upper limit (above Σ) define the range. Rules: Σ c·a_i = cΣ a_i, Σ(a_i + b_i) = Σ a_i + Σ b_i.
Systems of Inequalities: Graph both inequalities on the same coordinate plane. The solution region is where both conditions overlap (shaded regions intersect). This creates a bounded or unbounded region.
Systems with Parameters: Solve systems where coefficients may contain variables or parameters. Determine when solutions exist and predict how parameters affect the solution.
Tangent Function: y = tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x). Undefined at x = π/2, 3π/2, ... (where cos = 0). Vertical asymptotes at these points. Period = π.
Telescoping Series: Series where consecutive terms cancel: Σ (a_i - a_{i+1}) = a_1 - a_{n+1}. Useful for partial fractions decomposition.
Test Point Method: Mark the roots on a number line. Test one x-value in each interval in the original inequality. If true, the entire interval is part of the solution. If false, the interval is excluded.
The Discriminant: Δ = b² - 4ac. This value determines the nature and number of solutions. If Δ > 0: two distinct real solutions. If Δ = 0: one repeated real solution. If Δ < 0: two complex conjugate solutions.
The Elimination Method: Multiply one or both equations by constants so that one variable has opposite coefficients. Add the equations to eliminate that variable, leaving one equation with one unknown.
The Factor Theorem: (x-c) is a factor of p(x) if and only if p(c) = 0. This connects zeros and factors. To test if (x-c) is a factor, check if p(c) = 0 using synthetic division (if remainder is 0, it's a factor).
The Fundamental Theorem: The maximum or minimum occurs at a corner point (vertex) of the feasible region. Find all vertices and test each in the objective function.
The Number e: e ≈ 2.71828... defined as lim_{n→∞} (1+1/n)^n. The natural base appears in continuous growth and compound interest. Also appears as the base of natural logarithm.
The Process: Bring down the first coefficient. Multiply by c, add to the next coefficient. Repeat until all coefficients are processed. The last number is the remainder; other numbers are quotient coefficients.
The Quadratic Formula: x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / (2a). This solves any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 directly without factoring or completing the square.
The Remainder Theorem: When polynomial p(x) is divided by (x-c), the remainder equals p(c). This allows quick evaluation: instead of substituting into a complex polynomial, perform synthetic division and read the remainder.
The Substitution Method: Solve one equation for a variable, then substitute that expression into the other equation. This reduces the system to one equation with one variable.
Three-Variable Systems: Extend elimination and substitution methods to three equations with three unknowns. Use matrix notation or repeated elimination to solve systematically.
Transformations: y = A sin(B(x - C)) + D. A is amplitude (vertical stretch). B affects period (new period = 2π/B). C is horizontal shift. D is vertical shift. Tangent has period π, not 2π.
Transformations: y = log_b(x - h) + k shifts the graph. h shifts right (h > 0) or left. k shifts up (k > 0) or down. Vertical asymptote shifts to x = h. The reflection over the line y = x gives y = b^x.
Trigonometric Ratios: sin θ = y, cos θ = x, tan θ = y/x (on unit circle). Also cot θ = x/y, sec θ = 1/x, csc θ = 1/y. SOHCAHTOA helps remember right triangle ratios.
Two-Variable Data Analysis: Bivariate data pairs (x, y) from paired observations. Scatterplot shows relationship. Trendline captures general pattern. Must distinguish correlation (relationship exists) from causation (one causes other).
Two-Way Tables (Contingency Tables): Organize data for two categorical variables. Cell entries are counts. Marginal distributions shown in totals. Conditional probabilities calculated by dividing cell by row/column total.
Types of Asymptotes: Vertical: where denominator = 0. Horizontal: determined by degree comparison. Oblique (slant): when numerator degree = denominator degree + 1. Find by polynomial long division.
Types of Discontinuities: Removable: hole from cancelled factors. Non-removable/infinite: vertical asymptote. Jump: piecewise functions with different limits from left and right.
Types of Systems: Consistent and independent: exactly one solution. Consistent and dependent: infinitely many solutions. Inconsistent: no solution.
Understanding Applications: These theorems avoid long division. Instead of dividing p(x) by (x-c), calculate p(c) directly. If p(c) = 0, we know (x-c) divides evenly.
Understanding the Sign: Between roots, the parabola is either entirely above or below the x-axis. Outside the roots, it's on the opposite side. The sign doesn't change within an interval.
Unit Circle: Circle with radius 1, center at origin. Point on circle: (cos θ, sin θ). Angles measured counterclockwise from (1, 0). Complete circle = 2π radians. Special angles: 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, etc.
Using the Formula: Substitute a, b, c correctly (watch signs!). Simplify the discriminant first. The ± symbol means we find two values. Always check if the radicand is negative.
Using the Theorem: List all factors of the constant term and leading coefficient. Form possible rational roots. Test each using synthetic division (or p(c) = 0). This is efficient for polynomials degree 3 and higher.
Vector Basics: Vector has magnitude and direction: v = ⟨a, b⟩ = ai + bj. Magnitude |v| = √(a² + b²). Unit vector: u = v/|v|. Zero vector 0 = ⟨0, 0⟩. Position vector from origin to point (a, b).
Vector Equations & Applications: Line: r(t) = r₀ + tv (parametric form). Projectile motion: r(t) = (vcos α)t i + ((vsin α)t - ½gt²) j. Work: W = F·d. Physics problems model forces and motion as vectors.
Vector Operations: Addition: ⟨a₁, b₁⟩ + ⟨a₂, b₂⟩ = ⟨a₁+a₂, b₁+b₂⟩ (parallelogram law). Scalar multiplication: c⟨a, b⟩ = ⟨ca, cb⟩. Dot product: u·v = |u||v|cos θ where θ is angle between vectors. Also u·v = a₁a₂ + b₁b₂.
Vertex and Axis of Symmetry: The vertex is the turning point. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = -b/(2a) passing through the vertex. The parabola is symmetric about this line.
Vertical Asymptotes: Occur at x-values where denominator is zero (and not cancelled by numerator). These are "forbidden" x-values. Graph approaches these lines but never touches them. Plot as dashed vertical lines.
Vertical Shifts: f(x) + k shifts the parabola k units up (k>0) or down (k<0). Vertex moves from (h,k₁) to (h,k₁+k). The shape doesn't change, only the position.
Vertical Stretches and Compressions: a·f(x) multiplies the y-values by a. If |a|>1, the parabola stretches (gets narrower). If 0<|a|<1, it compresses (gets wider). If a<0, the parabola flips.
What is Completing the Square? A technique to rewrite ax² + bx + c as a perfect square trinomial plus a constant. This converts to vertex form y = a(x-h)² + k.
What is Linear Programming? A method to find the maximum or minimum value of an objective function subject to linear constraints. Used in business for optimization problems.
What is Synthetic Division? A faster method for dividing polynomials by linear factors of the form (x - c). More efficient than long division when the divisor is linear. Reduces calculation and is less error-prone.
What is a System? A system of equations consists of two or more equations with the same variables. A solution must satisfy all equations simultaneously.
When to Use Substitution: This method works best when one variable has a coefficient of 1 or -1, making it easy to isolate. If all coefficients are complex, elimination might be easier.
Work and Rate Problems: If one person completes a job in a hours and another in b hours, together they complete it in 1/(1/a + 1/b) hours. These lead to rational equations.
Writing Solutions: Use inequality notation for intervals. Solution might be x b (two rays), or a < x < b (one interval), or no solutions, or all real numbers. Express using interval notation or set notation.
Zeros and Factors: If r is a zero of p(x), then (x-r) is a factor. Zeros are x-intercepts of the graph. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree n has n zeros (counting multiplicity).
pH and pKa: pH = -log[H⁺] in chemistry. Logarithmic scale where pH 7 is neutral. pH 7 is basic. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses logarithms.
t-test vs z-test: Use z-test when σ known and n large. Use t-test when σ unknown (more common). t-distribution has fatter tails than normal, especially for small n.
