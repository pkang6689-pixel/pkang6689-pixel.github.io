    { question: "How does a rocket propel itself in space?", answer: "It expels exhaust gases backward; the gases push the rocket forward (Newton's Third Law)" },
    { question: "If a truck hits a small car, which experiences the greater force?", answer: "Both experience the same force (but different accelerations due to different masses)" },
    { question: "Does Newton's Third Law have exceptions?", answer: "No — it always applies" },
    { question: "In a collision, both objects experience the same force for the same time. What is conserved?", answer: "Momentum" },
    { question: "Why does the less massive object accelerate more in a collision?", answer: "Same force but smaller mass → greater acceleration (a = F/m)" },
