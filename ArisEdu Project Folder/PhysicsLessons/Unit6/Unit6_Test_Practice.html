    { question: "What is the general formula for gravitational PE?", answer: "PE = −GMm/r" },
    { question: "Why is gravitational PE negative?", answer: "Because work must be done against gravity to move mass to infinity; PE = 0 at infinity by convention" },

    { question: "What is the formula for orbital speed?", answer: "v = √(GM/r)" },
    { question: "Does orbital speed depend on the orbiting object's mass?", answer: "No — only on M (central mass) and r (radius)" },
    { question: "What is the formula for orbital period?", answer: "T = 2π√(r³/GM)" },
    { question: "Higher orbit: faster or slower speed?", answer: "Slower speed (but longer period)" },
    { question: "What is a geostationary orbit?", answer: "An orbit with T = 24 hours that stays above the same point on Earth" },

    { question: "What is the period of a geostationary satellite?", answer: "24 hours" },

    { question: "What is the total energy of an object at escape velocity?", answer: "Zero (KE + PE = 0)" },
    { question: "How is escape velocity derived?", answer: "Set total energy to zero: ½mv² − GMm/r = 0" },
