    { question: "What type of wave is sound?", answer: "A longitudinal mechanical wave" },
    { question: "Can sound travel through a vacuum?", answer: "No — it requires a medium" },
    { question: "What are the high-pressure regions in a sound wave called?", answer: "Compressions" },
    { question: "What are the low-pressure regions called?", answer: "Rarefactions" },
    { question: "What produces sound?", answer: "Vibrating objects (vocal cords, speakers, tuning forks)" },
    { question: "What is the human hearing range?", answer: "Approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz" },
    { question: "What is infrasound?", answer: "Sound below 20 Hz" },
    { question: "What is ultrasound?", answer: "Sound above 20,000 Hz" },
    { question: "Can sound be reflected?", answer: "Yes — this is how echoes work" },
    { question: "Can sound be diffracted?", answer: "Yes — sound bends around obstacles and openings" },
    { question: "What is the speed of sound in air at 20°C?", answer: "Approximately 343 m/s" },
    { question: "How does the speed of sound in water compare to air?", answer: "Much faster — about 1,500 m/s" },
    { question: "In which state of matter is sound fastest?", answer: "Solids (e.g., ~5,000 m/s in steel)" },
    { question: "How does temperature affect the speed of sound?", answer: "Speed increases with temperature" },
    { question: "Give the approximate formula for speed of sound vs. temperature.", answer: "v ≈ 331 + 0.6T (T in °C)" },
    { question: "When sound enters a denser medium, what changes?", answer: "Speed and wavelength change, but frequency stays the same" },
    { question: "Does frequency change when sound enters a different medium?", answer: "No — frequency remains the same" },
    { question: "If frequency doubles and speed is constant, what happens to wavelength?", answer: "It halves (v = fλ)" },
    { question: "Does humidity affect the speed of sound?", answer: "Yes — moist air carries sound slightly faster" },
    { question: "Why is sound faster in solids than gases?", answer: "Solids are denser and stiffer, allowing faster energy transfer" },
    { question: "What is sound intensity?", answer: "Power per unit area: I = P/A" },
    { question: "What is the SI unit of intensity?", answer: "W/m²" },
    { question: "How does intensity vary with distance from a point source?", answer: "Inverse-square law: I ∝ 1/r²" },
    { question: "What is the threshold of hearing?", answer: "~10⁻¹² W/m²" },
    { question: "What is the formula for sound level in decibels?", answer: "β = 10 log₁₀(I/I₀)" },
    { question: "An increase of 10 dB means intensity increases by what factor?", answer: "10 times" },
    { question: "An increase of 3 dB means intensity approximately doubles — true or false?", answer: "True" },
    { question: "What is the approximate decibel level of normal conversation?", answer: "About 60 dB" },
    { question: "What is the difference between intensity and loudness?", answer: "Intensity is objective (physical); loudness is subjective (perception)" },
    { question: "At what dB level can prolonged exposure cause hearing damage?", answer: "About 85 dB" },
    { question: "What determines pitch?", answer: "Frequency — higher frequency = higher pitch" },
    { question: "What frequency is middle C?", answer: "About 262 Hz" },
    { question: "What frequency is A4 (concert A)?", answer: "440 Hz" },
    { question: "What is an octave?", answer: "A doubling of frequency" },
    { question: "A4 is 440 Hz. What is A5?", answer: "880 Hz (one octave higher)" },
    { question: "What is timbre?", answer: "The tone quality that distinguishes different instruments playing the same note" },
    { question: "What determines timbre?", answer: "The mix of harmonics (overtones) in the sound" },
    { question: "What is a pure tone?", answer: "A single frequency (sine wave)" },
    { question: "What does the fundamental frequency determine?", answer: "The perceived pitch" },
    { question: "How does the ear perceive frequency?", answer: "Logarithmically — equal ratios sound like equal intervals" },
    { question: "In an open tube, what are at both ends?", answer: "Antinodes" },
    { question: "In a closed tube, what is at the closed end?", answer: "A node" },
    { question: "What harmonics does an open tube support?", answer: "All harmonics (n = 1, 2, 3, ...)" },
    { question: "What harmonics does a closed tube support?", answer: "Only odd harmonics (n = 1, 3, 5, ...)" },
    { question: "Formula for resonant frequencies of an open tube?", answer: "f_n = nv/(2L)" },
    { question: "Formula for resonant frequencies of a closed tube?", answer: "f_n = nv/(4L) where n = 1, 3, 5, ..." },
    { question: "What is the fundamental wavelength for an open tube?", answer: "λ₁ = 2L" },
    { question: "What is the fundamental wavelength for a closed tube?", answer: "λ₁ = 4L" },
    { question: "Is a flute an open or closed tube?", answer: "Open" },
    { question: "Is a clarinet effectively open or closed?", answer: "Effectively closed" },
    { question: "What are beats?", answer: "Periodic variations in loudness when two waves of slightly different frequencies interfere" },
