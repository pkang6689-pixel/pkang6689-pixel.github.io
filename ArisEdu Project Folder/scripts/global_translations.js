    "Key Concepts: Sample Spaces & Basic Probability": "关键概念：样本空间和基本概率",
    "A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.": "样本空间是实验所有可能结果的集合。",
    "Probability of an event: P(E) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of outcomes.": "事件的概率：P(E) = 有利结果数 / 总结果数。",
    "Probability is always between 0 and 1: 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1.": "概率总是在 0 和 1 之间：0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1。",
    "The complement of event E: P(not E) = 1 − P(E).": "事件 E 的补事件：P(非 E) = 1 − P(E)。",

    "Lesson 12.2: Independent & Dependent Events": "第 12.2 课：独立事件和非独立事件",
    "Key Concepts: Independent & Dependent Events": "关键概念：独立事件和非独立事件",
    "Events are independent if the outcome of one does NOT affect the other. P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B).": "如果一个事件的结果不影响另一个事件，则事件是独立的。P(A 且 B) = P(A) × P(B)。",
    "Events are dependent if the outcome of one affects the other. P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B|A).": "如果一个事件的结果影响另一个事件，则事件是非独立的。P(A 且 B) = P(A) × P(B|A)。",
    "Drawing with replacement → independent. Drawing without replacement → dependent.": "有放回抽取 → 独立。无放回抽取 → 非独立。",
    "P(B|A) is the probability of B given that A has already occurred.": "P(B|A) 是在 A 已经发生的条件下 B 的概率。",

    "Lesson 12.3: Conditional Probability": "第 12.3 课：条件概率",
    "Key Concepts: Conditional Probability": "关键概念：条件概率",
    "Conditional probability: P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A).": "条件概率：P(B|A) = P(A 且 B) / P(A)。",
    "P(B|A) is the probability of B occurring given that A has already occurred.": "P(B|A) 是在 A 已经发生的条件下 B 发生的概率。",
    "Use two-way tables to calculate conditional probabilities by restricting to a row or column.": "使用双向表通过限定行或列来计算条件概率。",
    "If P(B|A) = P(B), then A and B are independent.": "如果 P(B|A) = P(B)，则 A 和 B 是独立的。",

    "Lesson 12.4: Probability with Combinatorics": "第 12.4 课：组合计数与概率",
    "Key Concepts: Probability with Combinatorics": "关键概念：组合计数与概率",
    "Counting Principle: if event A has m outcomes and event B has n outcomes, there are m × n total outcomes.": "计数原理：如果事件 A 有 m 个结果，事件 B 有 n 个结果，则总共有 m × n 个结果。",
    "Permutations: order matters. P(n, r) = n! / (n−r)!": "排列：顺序重要。P(n, r) = n! / (n−r)!",
    "Combinations: order does NOT matter. C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n−r)!).": "组合：顺序不重要。C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n−r)!)。",
    "Use combinatorics to count outcomes, then calculate probability as favorable/total.": "使用组合计数来计算结果数，然后计算概率为有利数/总数。",
