    { question: "Why is water used as a coolant?", answer: "Its high specific heat absorbs lots of energy without large temperature change" },
    { question: "If q is negative, what does that mean?", answer: "The substance released heat (exothermic)" },
    { question: "What is heat capacity?", answer: "The heat needed to raise the temperature of an entire object by 1°C" },
    { question: "How does heat capacity differ from specific heat?", answer: "Heat capacity depends on total mass; specific heat is per gram" },
    { question: "Formula using heat capacity?", answer: "q = CΔT" },
    { question: "How do you calculate heat capacity from specific heat?", answer: "C = m × c" },
    { question: "Does a larger object have higher or lower heat capacity?", answer: "Higher — more mass means more energy needed" },

    { question: "Units of specific heat?", answer: "J/(g·°C)" },
    { question: "Two pools of different sizes have the same water temperature. Which needs more energy to heat?", answer: "The larger pool (higher heat capacity)" },
    { question: "Is specific heat an intensive or extensive property?", answer: "Intensive (does not depend on amount)" },
    { question: "Is heat capacity an intensive or extensive property?", answer: "Extensive (depends on amount/mass)" },

    { question: "If hot metal is placed in cool water, what happens?", answer: "Metal loses heat; water gains heat until thermal equilibrium" },
    { question: "What is thermal equilibrium?", answer: "When two objects reach the same temperature" },
    { question: "Formula used in calorimetry?", answer: "q = mcΔT for each substance; then set q_lost = −q_gained" },

    { question: "Why is water used in calorimeters?", answer: "Its specific heat is well-known (4.184 J/g°C)" },
    { question: "What is enthalpy (H)?", answer: "The total heat content of a system" },
    { question: "What does ΔH < 0 mean?", answer: "Exothermic reaction — heat is released" },
    { question: "What does ΔH > 0 mean?", answer: "Endothermic reaction — heat is absorbed" },

    { question: "What is Hess\'s Law?", answer: "Total ΔH is the same regardless of the pathway — it depends only on initial and final states" },
    { question: "Why is Hess\'s Law useful?", answer: "It lets us calculate ΔH for reactions that are hard to measure directly" },
    { question: "If you reverse a reaction, what happens to ΔH?", answer: "The sign flips (positive ↔ negative)" },
    { question: "If you multiply a reaction by 2, what happens to ΔH?", answer: "ΔH is also multiplied by 2" },
    { question: "What is a state function?", answer: "A property that depends only on initial and final states, not the path" },
    { question: "Is enthalpy a state function?", answer: "Yes" },
