                { question: "What is a confounding variable?", answer: "A hidden variable that influences both the explanatory and response variables" },
                { question: "Why is it dangerous to assume causation from correlation?", answer: "A lurking variable might explain both — only experiments can establish causation" },

                { question: "What is the difference between a frequency table and a relative frequency table?", answer: "A frequency table shows counts; a relative frequency table shows proportions or percentages" },
                { question: "How do you read a two-way frequency table?", answer: "Rows represent one variable, columns represent another; interior cells show joint frequencies" },

                { question: "Why do relative frequencies sum to 1?", answer: "Because they represent proportions of the whole data set" },
                { question: "How do you convert a frequency to a relative frequency?", answer: "Divide the frequency by the total number of observations" },
                { question: "When are two categorical variables associated?", answer: "When the conditional distributions differ across categories" },
