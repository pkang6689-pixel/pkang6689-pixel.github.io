The Process: Bring down the first coefficient. Multiply by c, add to the next coefficient. Repeat until all coefficients are processed. The last number is the remainder; other numbers are quotient coefficients.
The Quadratic Formula: x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / (2a). This solves any quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 directly without factoring or completing the square.
The Remainder Theorem: When polynomial p(x) is divided by (x-c), the remainder equals p(c). This allows quick evaluation: instead of substituting into a complex polynomial, perform synthetic division and read the remainder.
The Substitution Method: Solve one equation for a variable, then substitute that expression into the other equation. This reduces the system to one equation with one variable.

Vector Basics: Vector has magnitude and direction: v = ⟨a, b⟩ = ai + bj. Magnitude |v| = √(a² + b²). Unit vector: u = v/|v|. Zero vector 0 = ⟨0, 0⟩. Position vector from origin to point (a, b).
Vector Equations & Applications: Line: r(t) = r₀ + tv (parametric form). Projectile motion: r(t) = (vcos α)t i + ((vsin α)t - ½gt²) j. Work: W = F·d. Physics problems model forces and motion as vectors.

Velocity (vector): Rate of change of displacement. Average velocity = displacement / time.
Vertex and Axis of Symmetry: The vertex is the turning point. The axis of symmetry is the vertical line x = -b/(2a) passing through the vertex. The parabola is symmetric about this line.
Vertical Asymptotes: Occur at x-values where denominator is zero (and not cancelled by numerator). These are "forbidden" x-values. Graph approaches these lines but never touches them. Plot as dashed vertical lines.
Vertical Shifts: f(x) + k shifts the parabola k units up (k>0) or down (k<0). Vertex moves from (h,k₁) to (h,k₁+k). The shape doesn't change, only the position.
Vertical Stretches and Compressions: a·f(x) multiplies the y-values by a. If |a|>1, the parabola stretches (gets narrower). If 0<|a|<1, it compresses (gets wider). If a<0, the parabola flips.
